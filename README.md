- 👋 Hi, I’m @stepsequencer
- 👀 I’m interested in network archs, open-source projects, virtualization, ethical hacking and, of course, music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to manage projects on a master's degree
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cyberdefense or cybersecurity projects : I believe it should priorize the other lessons.
- 📫 don't hesitate to send me a pm if you need me.

thanx
